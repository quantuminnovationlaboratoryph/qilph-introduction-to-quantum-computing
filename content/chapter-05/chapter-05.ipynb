    "Tita Baby wants to send classical information to Tito Arnel. For example, this info could be her preferred restaurant from four choices: Jollibee, McDonald’s, Mang Inasal, and Popeye’s. \n",
    "\n",
    "These four choices can be encoded using two bits (Remember our classical computing module), such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "00 = Jollibee\n",
    "\n",
    "01 = McDonald’s\n",
    "\n",
    "10 = Mang Inasal\n",

    "To tell Tito Arnel where she wants to eat, without loss of information, she needs to send two classical bits. How can we improve this? \n",

    "Quantumly, Tita Baby can send just one qubit, but it needs to be entangled with a second\n",

    "As a communication protocol, this shows an improvement: Only 1 qubit is needed to be sent, compared to 2 classical bits. But computationally, this still requires 2 qubits."
